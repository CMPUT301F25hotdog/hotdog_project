## **Project Description**

The **Event Lottery System Application** is an Android app designed to ensure **fair and accessible registration** for high-demand community events. Instead of first-come-first-served signups, the app uses a **lottery-based system** to give everyone an equal opportunity to join events.  

Organizers can create events, define registration periods, and let entrants join waiting lists. When the registration period closes, the system randomly selects participants and notifies them. Entrants can then **accept or decline invitations**, and replacements are automatically drawn if someone opts out.  

This app emphasizes **fairness, accessibility, and transparency** in event registration while allowing **organizers, entrants, and admins** to interact within a unified platform.

## **Key Features**

- **Lottery-Based Selection:**  
  Replaces first-come-first-served signups with a fair random draw for event participation. Entrants only need to join the waiting list before registration closes.

- **Event Management for Organizers:**  
  Organizers can create and manage events, set registration deadlines, event capacities, and draw winners directly from the app.

- **QR Code Scanning:**  
  Entrants can scan promotional QR codes to view event details and join waiting lists instantly.

- **Notification System:**  
  Automatic notifications are sent when entrants are selected (“won the lottery”) or not selected (“not drawn”). Organizers can also send updates to waiting, selected, or canceled entrants.

- **Profile Management:**  
  Entrants can maintain personal profiles with editable information and a history of past lottery results.

- **Geolocation Verification (Optional):**  
  Organizers can enable location verification to ensure entrants are joining from a specific geographic area.

- **Firebase Integration:**  
  Real-time data storage for events, entrants, and notifications. Ensures instant updates across devices.

- **Accessibility and Fairness:**  
  Designed for users who cannot constantly monitor registration times — providing equitable chances for all participants.
